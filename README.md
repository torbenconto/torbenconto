## About Me
I'm Torben, a student developer with 4+ years of development experience. I'm experienced in systems programming with a specialty in Go and have a love/hate relationship with C and C++. I'm well versed in Linux and UNIX operation systems, including within containerized environments through Docker. I am continually learning new technologies and have lots of experience with backend development in Go. I also sometimes play around with React and Svelte for frontend development. I'm passionate about writing clean, self-documenting code that is scalable, lightweight, and efficient.
